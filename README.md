My proper implementation of machine learning algorithms from scratch


- Linear regression (with regularization) <br />
  -> Normal equation <br />
  -> Gradient descent <br />
 
- Linear regression (with regularization) <br />
  -> Binary classifier (Gradeint descent) <br />
  -> One-vs-All classifier (Gradeint descent) <br />

+ plotting data & boundary decision with matlab scripts
