My proper implementation of machine learning algorithms from scratch


- Linear regression (with regularization)
  -> Normal equation
  -> Gradient descent
 
- Linear regression (with regularization)
  -> Binary classifier (Gradeint descent)
  -> One-vs-All classifier (Gradeint descent) 


+ plotting data & boundary decision with matlab scripts
